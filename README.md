# Media Controls with Gesture
This is a progarm where the user is able to increase/decrease volume, and skip/prev media using nothing but webcam and hand gestures.

## How to use
### For increase/decrease volume
When you first hold only 2 fingers up (index and middle), it will mark the position where you first held those fingers up. 
Afterwards, while holding the 2 fingers up, depending on how much you move from that marked position, it will decrease/increase the volumn accordingly.
When you stop holding 2 fingers then the marked position will reset

### For skip/prev media
Hold up 3 fingers and if you swipe them to the right, it skips a media. If you swipe it to the left, it prev a media.
